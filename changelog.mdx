## Try New Features

Test the latest workflow chaining with this example. Create a chain that transcribes audio then summarizes it.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  import { Unitalk } from '@unitalk/sdk';

  const unitalk = new Unitalk({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

  const chain = await unitalk.workflows.create({
    steps: [
      { model: 'whisper-1', type: 'transcribe', input: 'audio.mp3' },
      { model: 'gpt-4o-mini', type: 'summarize', input: '{transcription}' }
    ]
  });

  console.log(chain.output);
  ```
  ```python
  from unitalk import Unitalk

  unitalk = Unitalk(api_key="your-api-key")

  chain = unitalk.workflows.create(
      steps=[
          {"model": "whisper-1", "type": "transcribe", "input": "audio.mp3"},
          {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "type": "summarize", "input": "{transcription}"}
